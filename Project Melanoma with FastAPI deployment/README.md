# Data science project implementing agile methodologies 

In this project, a classification model based on convolutional neural network was carried out to identify melanomas. The data was versioned with DVC and the code with git. The different metrics of the model were recorded using MLFlow and finally the deployment was carried out with FastAPI.

* `src`: the code or implementation of the project in Python should go here.
* `docs`: in this folder are the document templates defined in the methodology.
* `scripts`: this folder should contain the scripts/notebooks that will be executed.
