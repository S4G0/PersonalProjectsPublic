# Project Large Language Models (LLMs), Agents and Langchain

In this project, langchain was used in different LLMs, such as GPT2 through Huggingface and GPT3.5 using the OpenAI API, to extract information from a text database in different ways like:

* Using different prompts techniques.
* Through the use of agents.
* Making inference using the OpenAi embeddings  and ChromaDB to manage these embeddings.
* Using the Huggingface pre-trained model without changing it and performing fine tuning.
